# Meta Menu

Self-hosted, multi-tenant SaaS for restaurants to build digital menus by drag-and-drop. Public page at `/r/<slug>`; admin builds it from the dashboard with reorderable categories, items, image uploads, themes, multi-language overrides, plans, and analytics.

## Run it locally

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local            # then paste a fresh BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
docker compose up -d                  # postgres, redis, localstack
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

`bun run` lists every script; `make help` lists every deploy target.
