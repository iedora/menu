 * Single source of truth for brand + public URLs that appear in the UI.

 * Static / safe in both server and client components (no `@/shared/env`
 * import) — for RUNTIME urls (CORS origin, auth callbacks, etc.) read
 * `env.BETTER_AUTH_URL` from `@/shared/env` instead. The two stay in sync
 * because `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is set to `https://${APP_HOSTNAME}` in
 * `infra/kamal/config/deploy.yml`.
 *
 * To rebrand: change `BRAND_DOMAIN`. Everything else derives from it.
