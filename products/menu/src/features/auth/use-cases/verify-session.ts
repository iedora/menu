/**
 * Resolves the current session. Redirects to Genkan's /login when the
 * caller is unauthenticated; returns the (non-null) session otherwise.
 *
 * Genkan (auth.iedora.com) owns sign-in/sign-up UI for the iedora
 * ecosystem; menu is a session consumer. After successful sign-in,
 * Genkan bounces back to its configured DEFAULT_RETURN_TO (menu).
 *
 * The `return_to` query param isn't set here because Next 16 RSC has
 * no first-party way to read the request URL inside a use-case; the
 * proxy at `src/proxy.ts` does the cookie-presence check earlier and
 * can attach a precise return_to. This page-level guard is the
 * defense-in-depth backstop.
